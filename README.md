# XIVWindowResizer

Game window resizing plugin mostly intended for users who want to take screenshots at resolutions higher than their display resolution without going fullscreen and using DSR and similar features.

The window resizing code is a fully managed implementation of the code from the [XIVR](https://github.com/ProjectMimer/xivr) plugin.
